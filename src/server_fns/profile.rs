//! User profiles: the self-service "who am I" screen at `/profile` and the
//! read-only view of a colleague's profile at `/profile/:id`.
//!
//! Profiles are **need-to-know**, not public: a profile is only readable by its
//! owner, by a user with operations-admin permissions, or by someone who shares
//! a case with that user (both hold the `view_case` capability on the same case,
//! or own it).
//!
//! What a reader sees is narrower still. Name and role identify a colleague and
//! are shown to anyone who may open the profile at all; the contact details
//! (email, phone, home address) are personal information and are sent **only**
//! to the profile's owner and to users with operations-admin permissions. That
//! filtering happens server-side in [`load_profile`] — [`UserProfile::contact`]
//! is simply absent from the response for everyone else, so the details never
//! reach the browser.
//!
//! Editing is strictly self-service: [`save_my_profile`] always writes the
//! caller's own row. Account-level fields that are *not* the user's to change
//! (their email, which identifies the account for sign-in, and their role) stay
//! read-only here and remain Site-Admin-managed in
//! [`crate::server_fns::users`].
