//! The dedicated JSON API (SSR only).
//!
//! Plain Axum routes under `/api/*` returning JSON. This now covers only the
//! endpoints that must stay REST: the embeddable Squarespace chat widget
//! (cross-origin, hence [`cors_layer`]) plus health/version/docs. The CRM's own
//! authenticated operations are Leptos server functions in
//! [`crate::server_fns`], served under `/api/rpc/*`.
//!
//! Each feature area lives in its own submodule exposing a `routes()` function;
//! [`router`] merges them into one router.
