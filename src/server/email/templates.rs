//! Branded HTML email templates for app notifications (SSR only).
//!
//! Every notification email is built here so the look — colors, header, footer,
//! button, spacing — is defined once and shared by all message types. Callers in
//! [`crate::server::notifications`] hand us the *event* (who did what, on which
//! case) and get back a [`RenderedEmail`] with the subject line plus matching
//! HTML and plain-text bodies, ready for [`crate::server::email::send_email`].
//!
//! The HTML is deliberately old-school — table-based layout with inline styles —
//! because that is what renders reliably across email clients (Outlook, Gmail,
//! Apple Mail). Shared building blocks ([`layout`], [`button`], the
//! [`palette`](super::palette) colors sourced from the app's Tailwind theme, and
//! the per-kind [`Theme`]) keep the individual templates short.
//!
//! To *see* these without sending anything, use the offline preview tooling
//! ([`samples`], wired to the `preview-emails` CLI command) which renders every
//! template with placeholder data to standalone HTML files.
