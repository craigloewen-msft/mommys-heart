//! Provisioning a case's folder, and keeping the library's sharing invitations
//! in step with the app's own permissions.
//!
//! Two operations live here, and between them they are the only things that
//! write to the library's *structure* or its *access*:
//!
//! * [`ensure_case_folder`] — create a case's folder and its standing
//!   sub-folders, idempotently.
//! * [`sync_case_access`] — make the invitations on those folders match the
//!   capabilities recorded in `case_assignments`.
//!
//! # Why reconcile rather than grant and revoke in place
//!
//! Case access changes in six different places (assignment, a single capability
//! toggle, a batch save, unassignment, an approved access request, account
//! deactivation). Issuing an invitation at each of them would mean six chances
//! to forget the matching revoke. Instead every one of those places calls
//! [`sync_case_access`], which computes what access *should* look like and
//! changes only the difference. Granting and revoking are then the same code
//! path, and a call that fails is repaired by the next one rather than leaving
//! access permanently wrong.
