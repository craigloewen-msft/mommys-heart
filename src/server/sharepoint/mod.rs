//! Case documents in a SharePoint document library (SSR only).
//!
//! Case files live in a SharePoint document library, not in this database. Each
//! case gets a folder there, mirroring the standing tree in
//! [`NEW_CASE_FOLDERS`](crate::helpers::new_case_folders::NEW_CASE_FOLDERS), and
//! people reach it either through the case page (which renders the folder with
//! the app's own credentials) or in SharePoint itself (through a sharing
//! invitation the app issues on their behalf).
//!
//! Postgres keeps exactly two things: where a case's folder is, and which
//! invitations we issued. Everything else is read live, so there is no mirror
//! to drift.
//!
//! # The two audiences
//!
//! A case's top-level folders each declare an audience — volunteer-only or
//! shared with the client. That distinction is real access control, so
//! **invitations are issued per top-level folder, never on the case root**: a
//! volunteer is invited to all of them, a client only to the shared ones.
//! [`sync_case_access`] is the only thing that issues or withdraws them.
//!
//! # Reaching the library
//!
//! Everything goes through the [`DocumentStore`] trait, which has two
//! implementations: [`graph`], the real library, and [`local`], a directory
//! tree used when no tenant is configured. The trait is the only path to a
//! store, so "does this work locally?" and "does this work in production?" are
//! the same question asked of two implementations.
